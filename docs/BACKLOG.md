# Backlog

Actionable work items. When something ships, delete it — git history is the audit trail. For detailed designs, see linked docs in `docs/active/` and `docs/planned/`.

> **Purged 2026-07-06 for the grand-strategy pivot** ([grand-strategy-vision.md](./planned/grand-strategy-vision.md)): items serving the retired personal-player layer (mini-games, smuggling/bribes, hazard chains, reputation decoupling, trade-mission/ship-re-pricing rework, NPC trader agents) and the retiring Postgres runtime (batch writes, events query optimization) are deleted — git history has them. The pivot itself is tracked by phase in the vision doc §8, not here.

Sizes: **S** (hours), **M** (1-2 sessions), **L** (multi-session), **XL** (multi-week).

## Ready

Well-defined, can start now.

- **[S] Responsive navigation** — `GameNav` has no mobile breakpoints. Add hamburger menu or collapse below ~640px.
- **[S] Curated universe names** — Current procedural names are generic ("Forge-7"). Add curated name pools or hybrid naming for more flavour.
- **[S] Improve UI for dev cheat panel** — Other floating elements including the sidebar on the map get in the way of the dev cheat panel button. Move it to the header.
- **[S] Improve UI** — Standardize main content panel size, system detail smaller than command center.
- **[M] ECONOMY_SCALE isn't dynamically invariant** — The design intent is that scaling production + consumption together leaves the *dynamics* unchanged (only magnitudes move); `economy-scale-invariance.test.ts` asserts this — but only for **static** pricing/demand snapshots. The **full-tick dynamics are NOT invariant**: running the same seed + code at `S=1` vs `S=100` gives qualitatively different galaxies (e.g. seed 745878428 to 10k ticks — unrest mean 0.56 & colonies dying at S=1 vs 0.09 & thriving at S=100). Something in the goods→satisfaction→unrest / logistics-flow / population loop is in **absolute units** and doesn't ride `ECONOMY_SCALE`, so its ratio shifts with scale (symptom points at a floor/threshold that's harmless at high magnitude but dominates at low). This silently broke the "harness runs literally the same code as the game" invariant for the whole colony-calibration session (sim at S=1, game at S=100). **Task:** extend the invariance test to a **dynamic** check (run N ticks at two scales, assert scale-normalised metrics — unrest, per-good satisfaction, pop — match), bisect to the unscaled term, scale it. Until fixed, the harness only matches the game at the game's scale (now the code default, 100).
- **[M] System-finder dev tool** — A queryable dev panel (or `scripts/` CLI) to surface representative systems by characteristic for manual smoke-testing / QA: population band (dead/undeveloped/tiny-outpost/healthy), economy-type, deposit profile, building roster, NaN/anomaly checks — returning name + direct `/system/<id>` link. Recurring need whenever generation/economy changes land (e.g. verifying barren-but-alive systems read correctly). Build it against the in-memory world (`getWorld()`), surfaced in a `scripts/` CLI or the dev-tools panel.

## Needs Design

Direction is clear, approach needs a design doc before implementation.

- **[L] Paradox-style nested/pinnable deep tooltips** — Rich-tooltip infrastructure in the spirit of
  Stellaris / EU5 / Victoria: tooltips whose terms are themselves hoverable (nested), pinnable for comparison,
  backed by a cross-linking concept glossary so any mechanic term (labour grade, basket, anchor, fulfilment)
  explains itself anywhere it appears. Needs a real design doc + collaborative HTML-prototype pass. The
  shipped tooltip-affordance convention (grey dotted underline, see `docs/active/design-system/theme.md`)
  deliberately reserves a copper treatment as this system's future second tier for glossary-backed concept
  links. **Post-pivot this is core genre UI, not polish** — slot it once the player seat (pivot Phase 3) exists.

## Future

Blocked on prerequisites or very large scope.

- **[M] Switchable faction relation model** — `FactionRelation` currently stores one shared `score` per faction pair (symmetric). If the War re-spec or later play-testing reveals asymmetric opinions matter (one-sided grudges, vassal arrangements, "I trust you more than you trust me"), switch to per-direction scores. Two shapes available: (a) add `aOpinionOfB` / `bOpinionOfA` columns keeping the canonical-ordering convention; (b) drop ordering, store two rows per pair. Reevaluate when the pivot's diplomacy phase (Phase 5) or war (Phase 6) is specced.
- **[S] Flow-overlay particle thresholds vs economy-scale** — The map flow-overlay particle density (`LOGISTICS_FLOW` / `TRADE_FLOW` in `components/map/pixi/theme.ts`: `volumePerExtraParticle`, `minParticlesPerEdge`, `maxParticlesPerEdge`, `maxTotalParticles`) is tuned for S=1 flow magnitudes and is intentionally **not** scaled by `ECONOMY_SCALE` (client-side visual constants; the knob is server-only by design). At the calibrated S≈100 every edge pins at `maxParticlesPerEdge` and the global budget concentrates on the top flows, so the overlay loses its high- vs low-volume contrast (purely a legibility loss, not perf/correctness). Revisit the thresholds when running at the scaled economy; also a natural fold-in for the pivot's flow-system merge (Phase 4).
