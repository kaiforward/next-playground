# Player Progression Design

The player's journey from new trader to galactic power broker. Covers ship upgrades, region unlocking, credit sinks beyond trading, faction contributions, and the early/mid/late game arc.

**Status**: Stub — needs full design discussion.

**Depends on**: [Faction System](./faction-system.md) (reputation, war contributions), [System Enrichment](./system-enrichment.md) (facilities, traits)

## Open Questions

- Ship upgrades and progression path (linear? branching? specialization?)
- Unlocking new regions — how does a player expand their reach?
- Credit sinks beyond trading (faction contributions, facilities, fleet expansion)
- What's the early/mid/late game arc for a new player?
- How does faction reputation feed into progression? (exclusive ships, facilities, regions?)
- Fleet management — how many ships, what roles, how do they specialize?
