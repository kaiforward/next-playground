# Layer 2, Sub-Project 1 — Faction Foundation Implementation Plan

## Context

Sub-Project 1 of [Layer 2](./layer-2.md). The structural backbone of the political layer: replaces region-owned government with faction-owned government on a per-system basis, expands governments from 4 → 8, seeds 8 majors + 12–18 minors with archetype-respecting placement, ships inter-faction relations + alliance mechanics, adds per-player faction reputation, fires border-conflict events from the relations processor, and exposes a faction overview UI.

Every later Layer 2 sub-project (Facilities, Contraband, War) depends on this one. Foundation also carries the largest single delta in the roadmap — the regions → factions ownership migration — and a full reseed.

Layer 0 (system traits), Layer 1 (ship roster, upgrades, convoys, damage pipeline), and Layer 1.5 (mission architecture + combat engine) are all complete and stable.

## Source Design Docs

- [faction-system.md](../planned/faction-system.md) — all sections except §4 (war summary). Authoritative for faction model, doctrines, relations, alliances, reputation, roster, minor archetypes.
- [navigation-changes.md](../planned/navigation-changes.md) §6 — border-system tier-0 danger only (war-zone danger lands with War).
- [MIGRATION-NOTES §1](../MIGRATION-NOTES.md) — government ownership migration, region `dominantEconomy` re-derivation.

## Resolved Design Questions

The 5 open questions in [layer-2.md §3](./layer-2.md) are resolved as follows.

| # | Question | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Player spawn faction | **No primary faction.** Players are not faction-aligned at creation. No `primaryFactionId` field on `Player`. Reputation accumulates per-faction through player actions (trade, missions, future war contributions). Spawn continues to use `GameWorld.startingSystemId` (existing logic, pointing at a core-economy system near map center); the system happens to be faction-owned but the player starts with all-zero reputation. |
| 2 | Alliance formation | **Event-gated with telegraph + hook stub.** When relations cross +75, the relations processor spawns a `pact_under_negotiation` event with a 5–10 tick negotiation window. If relations hold above +60 through the window, the `AlliancePact` is created. Dissolution similarly telegraphed when relations drop below +50. The processor exposes a `pendingAllianceInfluence` hook (no-op stub in Foundation; populated by War's diplomatic-mission contributions). |
| 3 | Reputation multipliers | **Moderate symmetric, simulator-tunable.** Champion (+75 to +100) 0.92x buy / 1.08x sell. Trusted (+25 to +74) 0.96x / 1.04x. Neutral (-24 to +24) 1.0x / 1.0x. Distrusted (-74 to -25) 1.08x / 0.92x. Hostile (-100 to -75) trade denied. Values live in a single `REPUTATION_TIERS` constant; trade service reads them. |
| 4 | 8-government modifiers | **Flat per-government, extensible shape.** Match the existing `GovernmentDefinition` interface for all 8 entries — no per-good-tier matrices in Foundation. But the type allows an optional `goodCategoryModifiers?` field for a future per-category nuance pass without restructuring. Starting values for the 4 new governments in §3.1 below. |
| 5 | Minor faction count | **Tied to `UNIVERSE_SCALE`.** `default` (600 systems, 24 regions) → 12 minors. `10k` (10K systems, 60 regions) → 18 minors. New `MINOR_FACTION_COUNT` field added to `UNIVERSE_GEN`. Archetype counts scale proportionally. |

---

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Government ownership | Per-`StarSystem` via `factionId` FK; `Region.governmentType` dropped entirely | Border regions can contain systems owned by multiple factions ([faction-system.md §7](../planned/faction-system.md)). One-government-per-region is incompatible with the cross-border archetype. |
| Economy processor batching | Keep round-robin by region; resolve `governmentType` per-market inside the adapter | The processor body iterates markets within a region already. Adding `governmentType` to `MarketView` (joined from `system → faction`) lets the body apply the modifier per-market with a one-line change. No restructure of the round-robin loop. |
| `RegionView.governmentType` | Remove from the world interface | After government moves per-system, the type field on `RegionView` is dead. Drop it cleanly rather than letting it linger. |
| Region homogeneity | Not enforced | World-gen will tend to produce mostly-single-faction regions (factions seed around contiguous system clusters), but border regions are explicitly heterogeneous by design. No constraint. |
| `dominantEconomy` re-derivation | Hook function defined in Foundation, called only by world-gen; conquest hook stubbed | Region `dominantEconomy` is currently computed at seed time (per Layer 0). Conquest can change it (per MIGRATION-NOTES §1). The pure derivation function lands in Foundation; the conquest call site lands in War. |
| `Region.governmentType` migration | Hard cut, drop column | A full reseed is already planned. No data migration needed — schema diff plus reseed. |
| Dead `war` eventWeights | Delete from `GOVERNMENT_TYPES` | The "war" event referenced in `corporate`/`authoritarian`/`frontier` `eventWeights` was never defined in `lib/constants/events.ts`. Dead config; cleanup with zero risk. Replaced semantically by border-conflict events. |
| Faction relations storage | One row per unordered pair, convention `factionAId < factionBId` | Avoids duplicate (A,B)/(B,A) rows. Adapter resolves canonical ordering on every read/write. |
| Alliance representation | Separate `AlliancePact` table, not a column on `FactionRelation` | Alliances have their own lifecycle (formation tick, mutual defense state, future war contributions). Keeps relation score and alliance status decoupled. |
| Per-player reputation table | New `PlayerFactionReputation` with `(playerId, factionId)` unique | First per-player per-faction record in the codebase. Wire `TradeMission.factionId` stub column to a real FK in the same migration. |
| Faction-exclusive ship/module gating | Stub hook in Foundation, no variants yet | Roadmap commits to wiring the hook now. The accessor `getFactionShipAccess(playerId, factionId, shipTypeId): boolean` ships with a permissive default; faction-variant ships populate progressively in later layers. |
| Faction overview UI | New `/politics` route group | Existing sidebar has `FLEET_NAV` and `ACTIVITY_NAV`; add `POLITICS_NAV` for "Politics" (faction list) and reachable detail pages. The political map view is a new Pixi layer in the existing map. |

## Phase Plan

Five PRs in order. Each is independently mergeable; each leaves the game in a runnable state.

### Phase 1 — Data Model Groundwork (Pure Additions)

Pure-additive types, constants, and schema changes. No removals or behaviour cutover. Phase 1 alone leaves the live game running unchanged — the new tables exist but are empty; the new government literals exist but no faction uses them.

**New/modified files:**
- `lib/types/game.ts` — `GovernmentType` union expanded to 8 string literals: `federation | corporate | authoritarian | frontier | cooperative | technocratic | militarist | theocratic`. New `Doctrine` union: `expansionist | protectionist | mercantile | hegemonic | opportunistic`. New `FactionStatus` derived type: `dominant | major | regional | minor`. New `ReputationStanding` union for the 5 tiers.
- `lib/types/guards.ts` — `GOVERNMENT_TYPES` `ReadonlySet` and `ALL_GOVERNMENT_TYPES` array expanded to 8. New `DOCTRINES` set and `toDoctrine()` guard. New `toFactionStatus()` derivation helper (status from territory size with hysteresis thresholds from faction-system.md §1).
- `lib/constants/government.ts` — 4 new entries (`cooperative`, `technocratic`, `militarist`, `theocratic`) added to `GOVERNMENT_TYPES` matching the existing `GovernmentDefinition` shape (concrete starting values in §3.1 below). Dead `war: N` entries removed from `corporate`/`authoritarian`/`frontier` `eventWeights`. (Safe: the `war` event type was never defined, so no code path uses these.)
- `lib/constants/doctrines.ts` (new) — `DoctrineDefinition` interface (name, description, declarationModifier, exhaustionMultiplier, etc., per faction-system.md §1) and `DOCTRINES` record. Foundation only reads `declarationModifier` for the alliance negotiation threshold; the war-related fields are reserved for the War sub-project.
- `lib/constants/factions.ts` (new) — `FACTION_ROSTER` constant: 8 majors from faction-system.md §6 with name, description, governmentType, doctrine, color. Minor faction generation is procedural; this file holds only the major roster + the archetype distribution config (consumed in Phase 2).
- `lib/constants/reputation.ts` (new) — `REPUTATION_TIERS` constant: tier bounds, buy/sell multipliers, tier name. Helper `getReputationTier(score: number): ReputationStanding` and `getReputationMultipliers(standing): { buy: number; sell: number }`.
- `lib/constants/universe-gen.ts` — `UniverseGenConfig` gains `MINOR_FACTION_COUNT` field. `default` preset → 12, `10k` preset → 18.
- `prisma/schema.prisma`:
  - New `Faction` model: `id`, `name` (unique), `description`, `governmentType String`, `doctrine String`, `homeworldId String` (FK to `StarSystem`), `color String`, `createdAtTick Int`.
  - New `FactionRelation` model: `factionAId`, `factionBId` (with adapter-enforced ordering: `factionAId < factionBId`), `score Float @default(0)`, `historyJson String @default("[]")` (short ring buffer of recent drift drivers — debugging + UI surface), `updatedAtTick Int`. `@@unique([factionAId, factionBId])`.
  - New `AlliancePact` model: `factionAId`, `factionBId`, `formedAtTick Int`, `pendingDissolutionAtTick Int?`. `@@unique([factionAId, factionBId])` (only one pact between a given pair at any time).
  - New `PlayerFactionReputation` model: `playerId`, `factionId`, `score Float @default(0)`, `updatedAtTick Int`. `@@unique([playerId, factionId])`.
  - `StarSystem` gains `factionId String?` FK to `Faction` (nullable in schema; world-gen guarantees non-null after Phase 2 reseed).
  - `TradeMission.factionId` upgraded from stub `String?` to real FK on `Faction`.
  - `Region.governmentType` **stays** in this phase — column dropped in Phase 2.
- `prisma db push` to apply schema; no seed change yet.

**Testable after:** `prisma db push` succeeds. Type-check passes. The live game runs unchanged. Unit tests added for `toFactionStatus()` (hysteresis), `getReputationTier()` boundary values, `getReputationMultipliers()` lookup, and shape parity of the 4 new `GOVERNMENT_TYPES` entries with the existing 4.

---

### Phase 2 — World-Gen Rewrite + Government Cutover + Full Reseed

The cutover phase. Adds faction generation to world-gen, switches every consumer of government from `region.governmentType` to `system.faction.governmentType`, drops the column, reseeds. Pre-cutover and post-cutover both run; the cutover happens in a single PR so the game never holds a half-migrated state.

**World-gen — modified files:**
- `lib/engine/universe-gen.ts`:
  - `generateRegions()` — remove government assignment and the `ALL_GOVERNMENT_TYPES` coverage loop. Regions now carry name + position + `dominantEconomy` derivation only.
  - New `generateFactions(regions, systems, config, rng): GeneratedFaction[]`. Seeds 8 majors (one per government, per `FACTION_ROSTER`) with homeworld selection: highest-prosperity-traits system in each major's assigned cluster. Then seeds `MINOR_FACTION_COUNT` minors with archetype-respecting placement per faction-system.md §7.1:
    - Buffer: between 2 majors (count = ceil(0.33 × N))
    - Frontier: at map edges (count = ceil(0.33 × N))
    - Enclave: inside/adjacent to a single major (count = ceil(0.2 × N))
    - Cluster: shared region with another cluster minor (remaining count)
    - Constraints from faction-system.md §7.1 enforced: no minor borders more than 2 majors; every minor has at least one non-border system; frontier minors have unclaimed space on at least one side.
  - New `assignSystemFactions(systems, factions): Map<systemId, factionId>` — flood-fills system ownership from each faction's homeworld using jump-lane distance. Resolves contested systems via doctrine + distance tiebreak.
  - `selectStartingSystem()` — unchanged interface, but filters for systems in a Federation-government major's territory before the existing core-economy + map-center selection.
  - New pure helper `deriveDominantEconomy(systems): EconomyType` extracted from existing seed logic; used in world-gen and reserved for the future conquest hook.

**Cutover — modified files:**
- `lib/tick/world/economy-world.ts`:
  - `RegionView.governmentType` **removed**.
  - `MarketView` gains `governmentType: GovernmentType` (resolved at adapter from system's owning faction).
- `lib/tick/adapters/prisma/economy.ts` — `getMarketsForRegion` joins `system.faction.governmentType` and includes it on each `MarketView` row.
- `lib/tick/processors/economy.ts` — one-line change: read `government` from `market.governmentType` instead of `targetRegion.governmentType` for each market in the batch. The round-robin region selection is untouched.
- `lib/tick/adapters/prisma/ship-arrivals.ts` — `destination.region.governmentType` join replaced by `destination.faction.governmentType`. The `ShipArrivalView` type in the world interface updates accordingly.
- `lib/tick/adapters/prisma/op-missions.ts` and `lib/services/missions-v2.ts` — same join change.
- `lib/engine/simulator/types.ts` — `SimRegion.governmentType` removed; `SimSystem.governmentType` (or equivalent) added. `SimRunContext.systemToGov` already maps `systemId → string`; this is the per-system source post-cutover.
- `lib/engine/simulator/world.ts` — builds the per-system government map from faction ownership.
- `lib/tick/adapters/memory/economy.ts` — adapter reads `SimSystem.governmentType` per market.
- `lib/services/atlas.ts` and `lib/types/game.ts` (`RegionInfo`) — `governmentType` field on `RegionInfo` replaced with `dominantFactionId: string | null` and `dominantGovernmentType: GovernmentType`. Atlas service derives both from the modal owning faction within the region. (Border regions get the more common faction; ties broken alphabetically.)
- `app/(game)/@panel/system/[systemId]/page.tsx` — danger and Government stat rows read the system's `faction.governmentType` instead of `regionInfo.governmentType`. Faction name + color rendered alongside.
- `lib/map/mock-data.ts` and `lib/test-utils/fixtures.ts` — fixtures updated; new `createTestFaction()` helper added.

**Schema cutover:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma`:
  - `Region.governmentType` column **dropped**.
- `prisma db push` applies the drop.

**Seed cutover (`prisma/seed.ts`):**
- Drop `governmentType: region.governmentType` from `Region` writes.
- Insert `Faction` rows after regions, before systems.
- Set `StarSystem.factionId` per `assignSystemFactions()` output (non-null on every system).
- Insert `FactionRelation` rows: one per unordered major pair (28 pairs for 8 majors) + every minor↔major and minor↔minor pair within a proximity threshold. Initial scores seeded from doctrine compatibility + government opposition matrix (small +/- nudges per faction-system.md §6 "Emergent Rivalries").
- Set `GameWorld.startingSystemId` to a Federation-government major's homeworld.

**Testable after:**
- `npm run simulate` runs cleanly on the new universe.
- `prisma db push` + reseed produces 8 majors + 12 (or 18) minors with archetype-respecting placement.
- Every system has a non-null `factionId`; every major has exactly one homeworld system.
- Existing economy + ship-arrivals + missions tests pass against the new adapter shape.
- Generation tests: 100 seeds × archetype counts, no-minor-borders-3-majors, every-frontier-minor-has-edge constraints.

---

### Phase 3 — Relations Processor + Alliance Events

The processor that drives the political simulation. Spawns border-conflict events. Stages alliance formation/dissolution as events.

**New files** (following the processor-architecture pattern from `docs/design/active/processor-architecture.md`):
- `lib/tick/world/relations-world.ts` — `RelationsWorld` interface:
  - `getFactions(): Promise<FactionView[]>` — `{ id, governmentType, doctrine, territorySize, status }`.
  - `getFactionRelations(): Promise<FactionPairView[]>` — `{ factionAId, factionBId, score, lastUpdatedTick }`.
  - `getBorderLengthsBetween(): Promise<Map<pairKey, number>>` — shared jump-lane count per pair, derived from adjacent system ownership.
  - `getTradeVolumeBetween(sinceTick): Promise<Map<pairKey, number>>` — sums recent `TradeFlow` rows by faction-of-system on each end.
  - `applyRelationUpdates(updates: RelationUpdate[]): Promise<void>` — bulk score writes.
  - `getPendingAlliances(): Promise<PendingAllianceView[]>` — active `pact_under_negotiation` events.
  - `formAlliance(factionAId, factionBId, tick): Promise<void>` and `dissolveAlliance(...)`.
  - `createBorderConflictEvents(creates: EventCreate[]): Promise<void>` — delegates to the existing event-write path used by the events processor.
- `lib/tick/adapters/prisma/relations.ts` — implements against `Faction`, `FactionRelation`, `AlliancePact`, `StarSystem`, `SystemConnection`, `TradeFlow`.
- `lib/tick/adapters/memory/relations.ts` — in-memory implementation for the simulator. Borders and trade volume read from sim state.
- `lib/tick/processors/relations.ts` — `runRelationsProcessor(world, ctx, params): Promise<TickProcessorResult>`:
  1. Fetch all pairs.
  2. For each pair: compute drift from drivers in faction-system.md §2 (border friction, doctrine compatibility, government opposition, historical grievance decay, trade volume, alliance maintenance, common enemy). Sum to a delta; clamp resulting score to `[-100, +100]`.
  3. Bulk write updates via `applyRelationUpdates`.
  4. Detect threshold crossings:
     - Pair entering the unfriendly band (-74 to -25) without an active `border_conflict` for that pair → spawn **one** `border_conflict` event per faction-pair, targeting a representative shared-border system (the system on the lower-score faction's side of the densest border segment between the two). Subsequent skirmish phases never duplicate; a new event spawns only after the previous one resolves *and* the pair re-enters the unfriendly band.
     - Pair crossing +75 without an active `pact_under_negotiation` event → spawn one for that pair (single event, no system target — the event is region-scoped, system-agnostic, displayed on the political map only).
     - Pair dropping below +50 with an active `AlliancePact` → spawn one dissolution event for that pair.
  5. Resolve negotiation windows: alliance events whose `negotiationEndTick` ≤ current tick and whose pair score is still ≥ +60 → call `formAlliance`. Dissolution events past their window → `dissolveAlliance`.
  6. Allow `pendingAllianceInfluence` hook to mutate negotiation outcomes (no-op in Foundation; signature reserved for War).
- `lib/engine/relations.ts` — pure functions: `computeRelationDrift`, `derivePendingAllianceOutcome`, `borderConflictEventTemplate`, `allianceEventTemplate`. Fully unit-testable.

**Event catalog additions** (`lib/constants/events.ts`):
- `border_conflict` event type: 3 phases (`tension` ~20 ticks → `skirmish` ~30 ticks → `de_escalation` ~15 ticks). Modifiers: danger +0.05 in tension, +0.10 in skirmish, +0.02 in de-escalation, all on the participating systems (border systems between the two factions). Economy modifier: -10% production rate on participating systems during skirmish. Spawned only by relations processor — `weight: 0` so `selectEventsToSpawn` ignores it.
- `pact_under_negotiation` event type: single phase, duration = negotiation window. No danger/economy modifiers — purely informational. Renders on the political map.
- `alliance_dissolved` event type: single phase, brief duration. No modifiers.

**Modified files:**
- `lib/constants/government.ts` — delete the dead `war: N` entries from `corporate`/`authoritarian`/`frontier` `eventWeights`.
- `lib/tick/registry.ts` — register `relationsProcessor` with `dependsOn: ["events"]` and a slower cadence (e.g. `frequency: 3` — runs every 3 ticks). Order it after `events` so newly-created border-conflict events are picked up next tick.

**Testable after:**
- Unit tests for `computeRelationDrift` covering each driver in isolation and combined.
- Integration test: 1000-tick simulation produces border-conflict events on hostile pairs and alliance pacts on friendly pairs. No alliance forms instantly (negotiation window honored).
- The 4-tier relations status thresholds from faction-system.md §2 produce visible transitions in the sim log.

---

### Phase 4 — Player-Faction Reputation + Trade Integration

Hooks reputation into the buy/sell transaction. Adds reputation panel UI. Bootstraps player-faction rep rows.

**Modified files:**
- `lib/services/trade.ts`:
  - Query expands to include `station.system.factionId`.
  - After `calculatePrice()` returns `unitPrice`: look up the player's `PlayerFactionReputation` row for the system's faction. Derive `standing` from score via `getReputationTier`. Reject the trade if `standing === "hostile"`.
  - Compute `adjustedUnitPrice = unitPrice * getReputationMultipliers(standing).buy` (for buys) or `.sell` (for sells).
  - Pass `adjustedUnitPrice` through `validateFleetTrade` and the credit transfer.
  - Inside the `prisma.$transaction`: `upsert` the reputation row with a small delta (e.g. +0.5 per successful trade, capped per-tick per faction to prevent grind-spam).
- `lib/services/convoy-trade.ts` — identical changes (mirror of single-ship `trade.ts`).
- `lib/services/players.ts` (or `app/api/register/route.ts` — whichever owns spawn): on player creation, insert a `PlayerFactionReputation` row for every faction with `score: 0`. No starting nudge; players are pure neutral.
- `lib/types/api.ts` / `lib/auth/serialize.ts`: `serializePlayer` includes per-faction reputation rows.

**New files:**
- `lib/services/reputation.ts` — read service: `getPlayerReputation(playerId)`, `getStandingAt(playerId, factionId)`. No write path beyond what trade does (faction missions write their own rep deltas later; combat will too).
- `lib/hooks/use-faction-reputation.ts` — TanStack Query hook for the reputation panel.
- `app/api/game/reputation/route.ts` — GET endpoint for the current player's faction reputations.
- `components/factions/reputation-panel.tsx` — sortable list: faction name, score, tier badge, buy/sell modifiers. Reusable on player profile + faction detail page.
- `components/factions/standing-badge.tsx` — color-coded chip per `ReputationStanding`.

**Testable after:**
- Unit tests: `getReputationTier` boundaries, `getReputationMultipliers` lookup.
- Integration tests for trade: champion-tier player gets the discounted buy price; hostile player is denied; rep increments on successful trade.
- Reputation panel renders for an existing player and reflects 0s across all factions.

---

### Phase 5 — Faction Overview UI

The galaxy-political-map view, faction list, and faction detail page.

**New routes:**
- `app/(game)/politics/page.tsx` — Faction list: table of 8 majors + N minors with name, government badge, doctrine badge, territory size, status, color swatch. Filter and sort. Click → detail.
- `app/(game)/politics/[factionId]/page.tsx` — Faction detail: lore description, homeworld, doctrine, government, territory list (system count + sample systems), relations matrix row for this faction (other factions sorted by score with tier badges), recent border conflicts + active alliances from the event log, player's own reputation with this faction.
- `app/(game)/politics/relations/page.tsx` — Full N×N relations matrix view (8 majors × 8 majors initially; minors expandable). Color-coded by tier.

**New components:**
- `components/factions/faction-card.tsx` — small/medium/large variants, used in the list and on the detail page.
- `components/factions/relations-matrix.tsx` — square grid of pair scores, hover for full pair detail.
- `components/map/pixi/layers/political-territory-layer.ts` — new Pixi layer keyed by `factionId`. Reads `Faction.color`. Replaces the existing economy-colored territory layer when the political-map toggle is on. The existing economy layer stays — the user toggles between them via a map-overlay control.
- `components/map/political-overlay-toggle.tsx` — small overlay button in the map UI.

**New hooks:**
- `lib/hooks/use-factions.ts` — list query.
- `lib/hooks/use-faction.ts` — detail query for a single faction.
- `lib/hooks/use-relations.ts` — pairs query for the matrix view.
- `lib/hooks/use-political-overlay.ts` — client state for the map toggle.

**New API routes (thin wrappers):**
- `app/api/game/factions/route.ts` — GET list.
- `app/api/game/factions/[factionId]/route.ts` — GET detail.
- `app/api/game/factions/relations/route.ts` — GET full relations matrix.

**Modified files:**
- `components/game-sidebar.tsx` — new `POLITICS_NAV` array with Politics, Factions, Relations entries.
- `app/(game)/@panel/system/[systemId]/page.tsx` — government type now resolves via the system's owning faction; faction name + color shown alongside government. Existing `regionInfo?.governmentType` line replaced by `system.faction.governmentType` reads.

**Testable after:**
- Browser walkthrough: faction list loads, click into a major faction → detail page shows territory and relations. Political map overlay toggles cleanly. System detail page shows correct faction + government.
- Visual verification of color contrast for faction palette (8 majors + 12–18 minors = up to 26 colors; faction roster file specifies the major palette, minor palette is procedurally derived with sufficient luminance separation).

## 3.1 Government Modifier Starting Values (4 New Governments)

Per faction-system.md §1 sketches, refined into concrete values matching the existing `GovernmentDefinition` shape. These are starting values for the plan — simulator tunes from here.

```ts
cooperative: {
  taxed: [],
  contraband: ["luxuries"],
  taxRate: 0.10,
  inspectionModifier: 1.0,
  volatilityModifier: 0.7,
  dangerBaseline: 0.0,
  equilibriumSpreadPct: -10,
  eventWeights: { trade_festival: 3 },
  consumptionBoosts: { food: 1, medicine: 1 },
},
technocratic: {
  taxed: ["water", "food"],
  contraband: [],
  taxRate: 0.08,
  inspectionModifier: 0.6,
  volatilityModifier: 1.0,
  dangerBaseline: 0.01,
  equilibriumSpreadPct: 5,
  eventWeights: { tech_breakthrough: 5 },
  consumptionBoosts: { electronics: 1 },
},
militarist: {
  taxed: ["electronics", "machinery"],
  contraband: [],
  taxRate: 0.10,
  inspectionModifier: 1.3,
  volatilityModifier: 1.3,
  dangerBaseline: 0.05,
  equilibriumSpreadPct: 10,
  eventWeights: { trade_festival: -3 },
  consumptionBoosts: { weapons: 1, fuel: 1, machinery: 1 },
},
theocratic: {
  taxed: [],
  contraband: ["weapons", "chemicals", "luxuries"],
  taxRate: 0.10,
  inspectionModifier: 1.4,
  volatilityModifier: 0.8,
  dangerBaseline: 0.03,
  equilibriumSpreadPct: -5,
  eventWeights: { plague: -3 },
  consumptionBoosts: { food: 1, medicine: 1, textiles: 1 },
},
```

The optional `goodCategoryModifiers?: Record<GoodCategory, { volatility?: number; eqSpread?: number }>` field on `GovernmentDefinition` is **declared but unused in Foundation** — it exists so a follow-up tuning pass can express the "wide for tier 2, narrow for tier 0" nuance from the design doc without restructuring.

## Branch Strategy

Foundation ships as **4 PRs against main**, grouped by natural seam (bisectability + revert-safety, not review capacity). Each PR is independently mergeable and leaves the game in a runnable state.

| PR | Phases | Scope | Risk profile |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PR 1** | Phase 1 | Data model groundwork: schema additions, new constants, new types/guards. No behaviour change. | Low — pure additions, live game runs unchanged |
| **PR 2** | Phase 2 | World-gen rewrite + government cutover + full reseed. Adapters switch to `system.faction.governmentType`. `Region.governmentType` column dropped. | High — biggest single migration in the roadmap. Must stand alone for revert/bisect |
| **PR 3** | Phases 3 + 4 | Relations processor + alliance events + border-conflict events; player reputation + trade multiplier integration + reputation panel | Medium — runtime gameplay layered on top of the migrated data model. Tightly coupled (relations spawns events; reputation reads from same data) |
| **PR 4** | Phase 5 | Faction overview UI: political map layer, faction list/detail pages, relations matrix | Low — UI polish on top of working systems. Can absorb into PR 3 at merge time if scope feels right |

**Why 4 PRs, not one big one**: CLAUDE.md guidance — "Break large features into 2-4 phase PRs ... A 12-phase plan should ship as 3-4 PRs." Foundation's 5 phases fit comfortably in 4 PRs. Phase 2 in particular *must* stand alone — it changes ~10 adapters and reseeds the world; bundling Phase 1's groundwork or Phase 3's runtime code with it dilutes review attention on the risky bits and harms bisectability if a regression surfaces.

**Why not more (e.g. one PR per phase)**: Phases 3 and 4 are tightly coupled — the relations processor spawns events that the reputation system later cares about; testing one without the other is awkward. Splitting them produces two PRs that each block on the other, with no review-quality benefit.

**Branch flow** (per `MEMORY.md` worktree preferences):

1. Worktree per PR (`feat/layer-2-foundation-pr-1`, `-pr-2`, etc.) branched off `main`.
2. Within a worktree, commit per phase if a PR spans multiple phases (PR 3 = Phases 3 + 4).
3. Phase complete + tests green → cherry-pick to the PR branch → run code review (custom local skill).
4. PR merges to `main`. Next PR's worktree branches from updated `main`.
5. Delete the worktree immediately after merge.

This keeps each PR's diff bounded to one natural seam and gives `main` 4 stabilisation points across Foundation.

| Government-specific contraband/tax pipeline wiring | Contraband sub-project (the *data* lives in `GOVERNMENT_TYPES` after Foundation; the pipeline already reads government per-system once Phase 2 lands) |
| War declarations, exhaustion, battles, sieges | War sub-project |
| War-zone danger values in navigation pipeline | War sub-project |
| Faction-gated mission types (intelligence, diplomacy, escort) | War sub-project |
| Faction-exclusive ship variants | Future ship-roster expansion, gated by the stub hook in Phase 1 |
| Faction-flagship facilities at homeworlds | Facilities sub-project (or later) |
| Conquest hook for `Region.dominantEconomy` re-derivation | War sub-project (the pure derivation function is in Foundation Phase 2; the conquest call site lands with conquest itself) |
| Player-influence on alliance negotiation outcomes | War sub-project (the hook is stubbed in Phase 3) |
| Faction resurrection / rebel events | Far future (faction-system.md §7.1 mentions; out of scope here) |
| Per-good-category modifier nuance | Follow-up tuning pass (the field is declared in Phase 1) |

## Verification

- All Layer 1 + 1.5 tests still pass.
- `npm run simulate` runs cleanly on the new universe.
- New tests:
  - `getReputationTier` boundary values.
  - `toFactionStatus` hysteresis (gaining at +N, losing at +M).
  - `computeRelationDrift` per-driver isolation tests.
  - World-gen tests: 100 seeds × archetype constraint validation.
  - Trade service: reputation multiplier integration, hostile-denial, per-tick rep increment cap.
- Simulator validation:
  - 5,000-tick run with full faction roster: no faction destroyed (Foundation has no conquest), border conflicts fire on hostile pairs, alliances form on friendly pairs with telegraph delay honored.
  - Relation drift produces a believable political landscape — no single faction dominates relations universally, no faction ends in pure neutrality with everyone.
- Browser validation:
  - Faction list page loads and renders all 8 majors + N minors.
  - Faction detail page shows territory, doctrine, government, relations matrix row.
  - Political map overlay toggles cleanly, colors match `Faction.color`.
  - System detail page shows the system's faction name, faction color, and inherited government type.
  - Player reputation panel renders zero-rep state for new players; trading at a system bumps the owning faction's rep visibly.
- Stabilization checkpoint (per [MIGRATION-NOTES](../MIGRATION-NOTES.md)) is **not** triggered by Foundation alone — that fires after the full Layer 2 ships (Sub-Project 4 — War).

## Done When

- Reseed produces a universe owned by 8 majors + 12–18 minors with archetype-respecting placement.
- Every star system has a non-null `factionId`.
- Relations drift across thousands of ticks produces a believable political landscape — no single faction dominates; conflicts emerge organically.
- Border conflict events fire at unfriendly faction pairs and apply danger / economy modifiers via the existing event pipeline.
- Alliance pacts form (with telegraphed negotiation) and dissolve (with telegraphed warning) based on relations score.
- Players can see faction territory on the map, view their reputation with each faction, and feel reputation in buy/sell prices.
- All Layer 1 + 1.5 tests still pass; existing tick processors run unchanged against the new ownership model (the only processor body change is the one-line `governmentType` source-of-truth shift in the economy adapter; the body itself is untouched).
