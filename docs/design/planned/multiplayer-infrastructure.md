# Multiplayer Infrastructure Design

How players interact with each other — trading, alliances, communication, and coordination. The social layer that makes the faction system come alive.

**Status**: Stub — needs full design discussion.

**Depends on**: [Faction System](./faction-system.md) (faction reputation, war contributions), [Player Progression](./player-progression.md) (what players have to trade/share)

## Open Questions

- Player-to-player trading (direct trade, contracts, shared cargo?)
- Player alliances/guilds — formal system or informal coordination?
- Communication systems (chat, messaging, faction channels?)
- How do players coordinate to support a faction's war effort?
- Competitive mechanics — market competition, territory claims, faction influence races
- Social features — leaderboards, faction rankings, war contribution boards?
