# System Enrichment Design

What makes individual systems unique, valuable, and worth fighting over. Covers facilities, system traits/modifiers, strategic value, and how systems feel distinct beyond economy type.

**Status**: Stub — needs full design discussion.

**Depends on**: [Faction System](./faction-system.md) (territory control, faction bonuses), [Player Progression](./player-progression.md) (player-built facilities)

## Open Questions

- Facilities (shipyard, black market, refinery, naval base) — what exists, what do they do?
- System traits/modifiers (asteroid belt, gas giant, habitable world, orbital ring)
- What makes a specific system worth fighting over beyond location?
- Are facilities faction-built, player-built, or both?
- How do facilities interact with economy types and government types?
- Resource nodes — do some systems have unique or rare resources?
