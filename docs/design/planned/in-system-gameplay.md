# In-System Gameplay Design

The second major gameplay space alongside the universe map. When docked at a system, players engage with story content, missions, and activities that take place within the system — on planets, stations, in asteroid fields, and at facilities.

**Status**: Stub — needs full design discussion.

**Depends on**: [System Enrichment](./system-enrichment.md) (traits drive mission flavour and availability), [Player Progression](./player-progression.md) (progression gating), [Faction System](./faction-system.md) (faction missions, reputation)

## Role in the Game

- Available from the start — immediate engaging content for new players beyond pure trading
- Mission flavour tied to system traits (precursor ruins → archaeology, jungle world → biological survey)
- Faction reputation unlocks higher-tier missions
- Mix of singleplayer story content and multiplayer cooperative objectives
- Complements universe-level gameplay — trading and fleet management happen on the map, missions and story happen in-system

## Open Questions

- Mission types — what categories of in-system missions exist?
- Narrative structure — procedural, hand-crafted story arcs, or a mix?
- In-system UI — what does the player see and interact with when docked?
- Multiplayer missions — how do players cooperate on shared objectives?
- Trait-driven mission generation — how do system traits influence available missions?
- Rewards — credits, reputation, unique items, ship upgrades, facility blueprints?
- Replayability — how do missions stay fresh for players who revisit the same systems?
